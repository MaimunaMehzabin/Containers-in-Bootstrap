       <center><h1>PAINTING</h1></center>
        <p>Painting is a visual art form that involves applying pigment to a surface using tools like brushes or fingers, employing mediums such as oils, acrylics, or watercolors. It serves as a means of expression, allowing artists to convey emotions and ideas while capturing reality or evoking feelings through color and composition. Various techniques and styles—from realism to abstract—enhance individual expression. Historically, painting has reflected cultural values and societal norms, inviting viewers to engage with the artist's vision and emotions.</p>
